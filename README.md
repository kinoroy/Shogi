# Shogi
A Julia implementation of the Japanese game Shogi. (Repo ported from Fossil)

- Shogi offers peer networking so you can play against your friends! 
- An AI to play against if you have no friends!
- A GUI interface because who like playing a game on command line? 
- Many varieties of Shogi can be played like Mini-Shogi, Chu-Sogi, and Tenkiju-Shogi, because variety in life is good! :)

A project for CMPT 276, Fall 2016. You rock Karol!
